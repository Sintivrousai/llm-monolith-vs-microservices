# Application Development with Language Models
### Comparative Study of Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture

---

## 📘 Abstract
This study compares the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) — **GPT-4**, **Claude Sonnet**, and **Gemini** — for automated software development in two architectures: **monolithic** and **microservices**.  
Each model created a REST API application in Java, and the quality of the generated code was evaluated using **SonarQube**.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies
- Java / Spring Boot  
- REST APIs  
- Docker  
- SonarQube  
- GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, Gemini  

---

## 🧩 Methodology
1. Each LLM was tasked with implementing the same REST API application.  
2. Two versions per model: **Monolithic** and **Microservices**.  
3. Evaluation based on:
   - Code cleanliness & organization  
   - Error handling  
   - SonarQube metrics  
   - Development speed  

---

## 📊 Results
- The LLMs performed **better with monolithic implementations**.  
- **Service decomposition** in microservices implementations created challenges.
